                    <p>Data science is transforming the world by turning raw information into powerful insights that shape how we live, work, and interact. It combines statistics, programming, and analytical thinking to uncover patterns and make predictions. Businesses rely on it to understand customer behavior (like Netflix recommendations), while healthcare uses it to detect diseases earlier and develop personalized treatments. Data science is key to building smart cities, improving education, and driving innovation in every industry around the globe.</p>

                    <h2>My Calm Approach to Stress: Finding Peace in Campus Life</h2>
                    <p class="post-meta">October 3, 2025 by Tyreque Davis</p>

                    <p>University life can be exciting but also stressful, with deadlines, exams, and new responsibilities often piling up at once. I've learned that staying calm begins with balance and self-awareness. Each day, I take time to breathe, plan my tasks, and set small, achievable goals instead of trying to do everything at once. When I feel overwhelmed, I go for a walk around campus, listen to music, or find a quiet spot to reflect and clear my thoughts. Playing the steel pan also helps me relax and reconnect with myself. My faith plays a big role in keeping me grounded, reminding me that every challenge is temporary and can be overcome with patience and prayer. Talking with friends and sharing our struggles reminds me that I’m not alone, and their encouragement keeps me motivated. Stress is a natural part of university life, but by staying calm, focused, and positive, I’ve learned to handle it with confidence and find peace in the middle of everything.</p>
